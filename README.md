# Mental Health Analysis in the UK
This project explores mental health trends in the UK. My goal was to analyse patterns, behaviours, and attitudes toward mental health, with a focus on factors that influence treatment-seeking behaviour and general well-being.

## Project Overview
Mental health plays a major role in overall well-being and quality of life, making it an important area for research and intervention. As a group, we decided to explore this topic within the health domain, using data-driven insights to better understand mental health outcomes.
We used a dataset containing 292,364 rows and 17 columns, covering the period from January 2014 to January 2016.

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes:
•	Timestamp (datetime)
•	Demographics: Gender, Country, Occupation, Self-employed (Are you self-employed?)
•	Mental Health Indicators:
o	Family history (Do you have a family history of mental illness?)
o	Treatment (Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?)
o	Mental health history (Do you personally have a history of mental health illness?)
o	Days indoors, Growing stress, Changes in habit
o	Mood swings, Coping struggles, Work interest, Social weakness
•	Perception & Stigma:
o	Mental health interview (Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer?)
o	Care options (Knowledge of available care options)
Except for Timestamp, all attributes were string data types, so part of our work involved cleaning and transforming data into a format suitable for analysis.

## Objectives
•	Explore mental health prevalence across demographic groups.
•	Analyse the relationship between family history, personal history, and treatment-seeking behaviour.
•	Identify patterns related to mood swings, coping struggles, and work interest.
•	Visualize key trends and insights using Python data visualization libraries.

## Approach
1.	Data Cleaning – Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing categorical data.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Using statistical summaries to understand distributions and trends.
3.	Visualization – Creating plots to identify patterns across demographics and mental health indicators.
4.	Insights – Highlighting key findings such as which groups are more likely to seek treatment, experience mood swings, or face coping struggles.

## Tech Stack
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook
•	Libraries:
o	pandas (data manipulation)
o	numpy (numerical operations)
o	matplotlib & seaborn (visualizations)

## Future Work
•	Build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of mental health issues based on demographic and behavioural attributes.
•	Expand analysis to include geographical comparisons or time-series trends.
